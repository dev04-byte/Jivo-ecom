# PO Form Modifications Summary

## Changes Made to `modern-po-form.tsx`

### 1. Appointment Date Field - Show Only in Edit Mode
- **Change**: Appointment date field is now only visible in edit mode
- **Implementation**: Wrapped the appointment date field with `{editMode && (...)}`
- **Location**: Lines 1842-1856
- **Behavior**: 
  - ✅ **Creation Mode**: Appointment field is hidden
  - ✅ **Edit Mode**: Appointment field is visible and editable

### 2. Distributor-Dispatch From Locking Logic
- **Change**: When a distributor is selected, the dispatch_from field becomes locked (disabled)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `selectedDistributor` watch variable
  - Modified dispatch_from field with conditional disable logic
  - Added visual indicators (locked badge and warning text)
  - Added useEffect to clear dispatch_from when distributor is selected

#### Visual Enhancements:
- **Lock Badge**: Shows "Locked - Distributor Selected" when distributor is chosen
- **Placeholder Text**: Changes to "LOCKED - REMOVE DISTRIBUTOR TO EDIT" when locked
- **Warning Message**: Explains why field is locked and how to unlock it
- **Styling**: Gray background when locked to indicate disabled state

#### Behavior:
- ✅ **No Distributor Selected**: Dispatch From field is editable
- ✅ **Distributor Selected**: Dispatch From field is locked and cleared
- ✅ **Remove Distributor**: Dispatch From field becomes editable again

### 3. Code Locations:
- **Appointment Field**: Lines 1842-1856
- **Distributor Watch**: Line 198
- **Locking Effect**: Lines 855-863
- **Dispatch From Field**: Lines 1679-1732

### 4. User Experience:
1. **Create New PO**: Appointment field is not shown, reducing form clutter
2. **Edit Existing PO**: Appointment field is available for modification
3. **Select Distributor**: Dispatch From automatically locks and clears
4. **Clear Distributor**: Dispatch From becomes available for selection again

### 5. Technical Details:
- Uses `editMode` prop to conditionally render appointment field
- Uses `form.watch("distributor")` to monitor distributor selection
- Uses `useEffect` to automatically clear conflicting fields
- Proper TypeScript types with `Boolean()` wrapper for complex conditions
- Maintains existing form validation and error handling
