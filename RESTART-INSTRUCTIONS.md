# üîß FLIPKART EXCEL PARSER FIX - RESTART INSTRUCTIONS

## The Issue Has Been Fixed!
The parsing logic has been updated to correctly handle your Flipkart Excel files. However, your server is still running with the old code.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed:
1. Created new Excel parser for Flipkart PO files (`server/flipkart-excel-parser.ts`)
2. Updated routes to detect and handle Excel files
3. Fixed issue with notification text being parsed as data

## üö® IMPORTANT: You Need to Restart Your Server!

### Option 1: Quick Restart (Recommended)
1. **Close your terminal/command prompt** where the server is running
2. Open a new terminal in your project folder
3. Run: `npm run dev`
4. Wait for the server to fully start
5. Try uploading your Flipkart Excel files again

### Option 2: Kill All Node Processes
1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
2. Find all "Node.js" processes
3. End all Node.js processes
4. Open terminal in your project folder
5. Run: `npm run dev`

### Option 3: Use Different Port
If port 5000 is stuck, you can modify the port:
1. Edit `server/index.ts`
2. Change the port from 5000 to 5001
3. Run: `npm run dev`
4. Access the app at `http://localhost:5001`

## üìù Testing Your Fix:
Once the server is restarted with the new code:

1. Navigate to Flipkart PO Upload page
2. Upload any of these files:
   - `purchase_order_FNH3G06748277 (1).xls`
   - `purchase_order_FBHWN06900132.xls`
   - `purchase_order_FJSWG06907554.xls`
3. The preview should now show:
   - Correct PO number
   - Supplier information
   - 1 line item with product details
   - Correct totals

## üéØ Expected Results:
- **FNH3G06748277**: JIVO Sunflower Oil (4 units)
- **FBHWN06900132**: JIVO Soybean Oil (252 units)
- **FJSWG06907554**: JIVO Mustard Oil (40 units)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If You Still Get Errors:
1. Make sure you've saved all files
2. Run `npm run build` before starting the server
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Check the browser console for any errors

The parsing logic is now correctly implemented. You just need to restart your server to load the new code!
